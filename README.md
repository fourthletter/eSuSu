Inspiration

Our team members live with student debt and have families who use alternative financial products outside of mainstream banking. We believe that crowd lending will help communities who no longer trust mainstream banks acquire credit, loans, and build savings.
What it does

eSuSu is a platform for friends, family members, colleagues, and neighbors to form groups to loan each other. Peers will be able to lend to each other and motivate each other to save through our platform. People who save in a group are more likely to succeed than those who do it alone. A platform will allow users to track their lending and financial transactions.
How we built it

We used lean stack technologies and integrated the Office 365 into our API.
Challenges we ran into

It was challenging to create a platform from traditional concepts and incorporating it into a package solution.
Accomplishments

We completed the platform in record time and worked well as a team.
What we learned

Our lessons include taking more time to shape our ideas, e.g., ideation prior to starting coding.
What's next for esusu

We plan to launch our platform this year! Our team plan on continuiing this project after this hackathon.
